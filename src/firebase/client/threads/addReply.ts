/**
 * Adds a reply to a thread with complete workflow including file uploads, reactions setup, and notifications
 *
 * This function performs the following operations:
 * 1. Creates a new reply document in the thread's replies subcollection
 * 2. Uploads any attached files to Firebase Storage and links them to the reply
 * 3. Updates the parent thread's reply count and flow time
 * 4. Initializes reaction data for the new reply (with author as sole subscriber)
 * 5. Sends notification to thread owner (if different from reply author)
 *
 * @param thread - The thread to add the reply to
 * @param author - The author's UID who is creating the reply
 * @param markdownContent - The reply content in markdown format
 * @param quoteref - Optional reference to quoted message/reply key
 * @param files - Optional array of files to upload and attach to the reply
 * @returns Promise that resolves when reply is successfully added (notifications are fire-and-forget)
 * @throws Error if reply creation, file upload, or thread update fails
