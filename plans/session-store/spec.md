# Session Store Specification

## Overview

The Session Store is a client-side reactive data layer that manages the **session state information** to drive the UI. It serves as the single source of truth for the *application's view* of the current user.

> **Note:** This store manages the *visualization* and *client-side state* of the session. The actual session security, authentication mechanics, and server-side persistence involve a broader system of Firebase Auth tokens, HTTP-only cookies, and SSR validation. For the full security model and authentication architecture, please refer to `plans/session-and-auth/spec.md`.

It is built using `nanostores` for state management and bridges the gap between the authoritative `firebase/auth` SDK and the application's reactive UI components.

## Architecture

The session store is composed of several specialized stores:
-   **Core Session Store** (`src/stores/session/index.ts`): Manages the high-level session state (`initial`, `loading`, `active`, `error`) and the `uid`.
-   **Account Store** (`src/stores/session/account.ts`): Manages private user data (settings, last login).
-   **Profile Store** (`src/stores/session/profile.ts`): Manages public user data (nick, avatar).
-   **Subscriber Store** (`src/stores/session/subscriber.ts`): Manages content consumption state (read receipts).

### Key Dependencies
-   `nanostores`: Atomic state management.
-   `@nanostores/persistent`: LocalStorage persistence for session recovery.
-   `firebase/auth`: Identity provider.
-   `firebase/firestore`: Data storage for accounts, profiles, and subscriptions.

## State Management

### Session State Cycle
The `sessionState` atom tracks the lifecycle of the user's session:

1.  **`initial`**: App start, no active session.
2.  **`loading`**: Authentication or logout in progress.
3.  **`active`**: User is authenticated, data is subscribed.
4.  **`error`**: Authentication failed.

**Note**: To prevent infinite loading states, the store resets `loading` to `initial` on module execution if detected (e.g., after a page reload during a stuck process).

### Computed Helpers
-   **`active`**: `true` if `sessionState` is `'active'`.
-   **`anonymous`**: `true` if `active` is `false` or `uid` is missing (though in practice `active` implies `uid` presence for logged-in users).
-   **`requiresEula`**: Checks if the user needs to accept the EULA (based on `account` data).
-   **`showAdminTools`**: Checks if the user is an admin (based on `appMeta` store).

## persistence strategy

Critical session data is persisted to `localStorage` to provide a seamless experience across reloads:
-   `session-state` -> `sessionState`
-   `session-uid` -> `uid`
-   `session-account` -> `account`
-   `session-profile` -> `profile`
-   `subscriberStore` -> `subscriber`

## Authentication Flows

### Initialization (`onMount`)
The store listens to `firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged`:

1.  **User Detected**:
    -   If valid user + matching `uid` + active session:
        -   Refreshes subscriptions (Account/Profile) to ensure data is fresh.
        -   Logs: "Refreshed subscriptions for active session".
    -   If new/changed user:
        -   Sets state to `loading`.
        -   Fetches new ID token.
        -   **Server Sync**: POSTs token to `/api/auth/session` to create a strict session cookie (HTTPOnly, Secure, 5 days).
        -   Subscribes to Firestore data (Account, Profile).
        -   Sets `uid` and initializes `subscriberStore`.
        -   Sets state to `active`.

2.  **User Logged Out**:
    -   If state was not `initial`:
        -   Triggers `logout()` cleanup.
    -   Else:
        -   Stays strictly `initial`.

### Logout
The `logout()` function performs a complete cleanup:
1.  Sets state to `loading`.
2.  Clears all local stores (`uid`, `account`, `profile`).
3.  Signs out from `firebase/auth`.
4.  **Server Sync**: DELETE request to `/api/auth/session` to remove the session cookie.
5.  Sets state to `initial`.

## Sub-Stores Detail

### Account Store
-   **Source**: `ACCOUNTS_COLLECTION_NAME` (Firestore).
-   **Logic**:
    -   Subscribes to the user's account document.
    -   Updates `lastLogin` timestamp if > 24 hours since last update.
    -   Parses data using `AccountSchema` (JSON safe).
    -   Handles EULA acceptance check (`eulaAccepted`).

### Profile Store
-   **Source**: `PROFILES_COLLECTION_NAME` (Firestore).
-   **Logic**:
    -   Subscribes to user's profile.
    -   **Migration**: Attempt to autos-migrate legacy profile structures if parsing fails.
    -   Tracks `profileMissing` state if no profile document exists.

### Subscriber Store
-   **Source**: `SUBSCRIPTIONS_FIRESTORE_PATH` (Firestore).
-   **Logic**:
    -   Tracks `seenEntities` map (entity ID -> timestamp).
    -   Provides `hasSeenEntry(key, timestamp)` check.
    -   Updates Firestore explicitly on read (via `markEntrySeen`).
    -   Auto-creates empty subscription doc if missing.

## Server-Side Integration
The client-side store syncs with Astro's server-side session via API routes:
-   **`POST /api/auth/session`**: Validates ID Token, sets `session` cookie.
-   **`DELETE /api/auth/session`**: Clears `session` cookie.

This enables Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) to perform server-side checks (e.g. for protected routes) using the secure cookie.

## Consumers & Policy

While this store provides the *state*, it does not enforce navigation or access control policies. That is handled by consumers of this store.

### AuthManager (`src/components/svelte/AuthManager.svelte`)
*   **Role**: Policy Enforcer (Client-Side).
*   **Responsibility**:
    *   Listens to auth state changes in parallel.
    *   Checks for specific custom claims (`eula_accepted`, `account_created`).
    *   Performs **Client-Side Gating**: Redirects users to `/onboarding` if they are authenticated but missing required lifecycle steps.
    *   Handles **Token Repair**: Checks `/api/auth/status` and forces token refreshes if server-side claims have changed (e.g., after accepting EULA).

## UI Implementation Guidelines (The "Optimistic UID" Problem)

Because `uid` and `profile` are persisted in `localStorage` via `persistentAtom`, they are available **synchronously/immediately** on page load, *before* Firebase Auth has verified the session. This creates a potential divergence between "Persisted State" and "Verified State".

### The Problem
*   **Initial State**: `sessionState` is `'initial'`.
*   **Persisted State**: `uid` is `'user_123'` (from previous session).
*   **Result**: Naive components checking `if ($uid)` will render as if logged in immediately.

### Best Practices

#### 1. Validating "Active" Session
Components that trigger actions or require a valid token **MUST** check that the session is truly active, not just that a UID exists.

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Checks if the session is fully verified
const isAuthenticated = $derived($sessionState === 'active');

// ❌ Bad: Relies on potentially stale localStorage data
const isAuthenticated = $derived(!!$uid);
```

#### 2. Handling the "Loading/Rehydrating" State
Components should account for the state where a `uid` exists but verification is pending (`initial` or `loading`).

```typescript
const isRehydrating = $derived(
  ($sessionState === 'initial' || $sessionState === 'loading') && 
  $uid !== ''
);
```

*   **Recommendation**: Show a loader or a skeleton state during `isRehydrating`.
*   **Alternative (Optimistic)**: You *may* show the user's avatar/nick based on `$profile` (persisted) during this phase to reduce layout shift, but ensure interactions are disabled or queued until `$sessionState === 'active'`.

#### 3. Inbox & Notifications
Exceptions can be made for read-only indicators (like "9+ messages") based on persisted data (`$uid`), as long as clicking them handles the potential need to wait for full hydration.

## 7. Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### Missing Standardized Helper
**Issue**: Components currently implement ad-hoc logic to check for authentication, often conflating "Persisted UID" with "Active Session". There is no single, robust primitive to cleanly switch UI based on the *actual* state.

**Requirement**: A helper (e.g., `useSession` or `$sessionStatus`) should be introduced to expose:
1.  `isAnonymous`: Truly no session (no UID, state is initial).
2.  `isRehydrating`: UID exists but state is `initial` or `loading`.
3.  `isActive`: UID exists AND state is `active` (Token verified).

**Remediation**: Implement this helper in `src/stores/session/computed.ts` and refactor critical components (`SettingNavigationButton`, `InboxNavigationButton`) to use it.
